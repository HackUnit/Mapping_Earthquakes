# Mapping_Earthquakes

## By Magnitudes

The purpose of this project was to first show the differences in magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven day. This would be done by pulling appropriate GeoJSON data from the USGS website and then adding that data to an interactive map. JavaScript, the D3.js/Leaflet libraries, and a Mapbox API was used to create the interactive map, which has a magnitude legend and a toggle for different map backgrounds.

## Tectonic Plates, Magnitudes and a new Map

The project was then further broadend by adding a tectonic plate overlay to see the relation between earthquake data and the locations of the tectonic plates. Furthermore, the code for the map was refactored to allow for earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 to be shown on the map. Finally, a third map was created to see the data on a dark background. All of this together created a map that had toggles for the background map and also for the three types of data as overlays.
